# fermata
a small language i am working on for funsies

## focus features
- data and codata
- ad hoc polymorphism (by codata via user defined subtyping/intersection types)
- pure
- algebraic effects (might be doable with codata? idk we will see)
- simple

prolly gonna be garbage collected ngl but would be cool to explore other means of memory management, thats a later problem though

## other
some features that might be cool:
- actor model
  - study actor model and pi calculus more
  - look into the pony language more
  - actor model might work nicely with codata idk
- please at least try to have only one idiomatic way to do things
- targets:
  - jvm bytecode :0
  - compiling to assembly would be great too ngl
- would be nice to be fast, see roc lang for ideas
  - is data oriented design as a compilation target a good idea for speed?
