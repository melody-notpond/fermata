# fermata
A small language I am working on.

## focus features
- data and codata
- ad hoc polymorphism (via user defined subtyping and intersection types)
- pure
- algebraic effects
- simple

prolly gonna be garbage collected ngl but would be cool to explore other means of memory management, thats a later problem though

## other
some features that might be cool:
- actor model
  - study actor model and pi calculus more
  - reference capabilities??
  - look into the pony language more
  - actor model might work nicely with codata idk
- please at least try to have only one idiomatic way to do things
- targets:
  - compiling to assembly would be great
  - webassembly is also really cool
  - a treewalk interpreter is better than nothing for a prototype
