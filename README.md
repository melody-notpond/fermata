# fermata
A small language I am working on.

## focus features
- simple
- powerful comptime
- safe

## other
some features that might be cool:
- actor model
  - study actor model and pi calculus more
  - reference capabilities??
  - look into the pony language more
- functional oriented
- simple
- no mutable state, only immutable state
- memory safe
  - linear types?
  - region allocation and region inference?
  - garbage collection?
- comptime
  - maybe have typeclasses be comptime structures
  - look into zig comptime
  - macro system derived from comptime would be cool
- please at least try to have only one idiomatic way to do things
  - this means you likely wont use all of this list! thats okay!
- targets:
  - compiling to assembly would be great
  - webassembly is also really cool
  - a bytecode interpreter is better than nothing
